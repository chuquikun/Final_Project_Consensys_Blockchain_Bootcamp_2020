# Guitar registry and trade platform 

## Premise :
  
  The idea was to create a platform where the people could trade instruments with the certainty that the instruments are original, thanks to blockchain we have a  inmutable ledger of all the transactions and the history of each instrument from the building and passing from hand to hand until the current owner. Also, the users could be more aware of the prices of the instruments in the time  so they would have more tools to decide if it is a good buying or not.
  In the other hand we are providing a great management and recording tool for the productions of the brand, so the owner could be more aware of the situtaion of his company.


## The contract :

  It has all the logic neecssary to deploy a new guitar brand to the blockchain environment, so a big manufcturer or small one could use it to relate his brand to a contract address. 
  The brand owner and deployer will manage his parterns by granting the roles of  **factories** or **dealers** to them, the owner is also by default the first factory. 
  The factories has the right to **"mint"** or build new instrument, both roles has are the only ones that can sell new instruments. To be a delaer you must have a partnership with a factory so the factories manage this roles and can revoke them or grant them.
  Finally the regular users could use the contract or the application to buy and re-sell the guitars built by the brand, if the sell the instruments it would be as seond hand instruments.
  Each owner of instrument will have the rigth tochange the sales status of his sinstruments any time. If the company goes out of business the owner will have the ability to pause the manufacturing of new guitars, but the guitars owner cwill be able to trade thier instruments yet.
 
## App : 
  
  The applications is an online guitar store for a specific brand whose backend is supported by smart contract that runs and records all the transactions on the blockchain.
